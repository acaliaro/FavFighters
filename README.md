Adapted sample code for blog post here: https://blog.verslu.is/xamarin/xamarin-forms-xamarin/swipeview-interaction-with-xamarin-forms/

Starting from Gerald demo, I try to have only one swipable item a time. Because of https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/10466#issuecomment-713139352 , it works only for the first swipped item...
